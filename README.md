## Documentation

The official Animate.css documentation can be found at https://animate.style. You can view a list of all animations that your able to use with this component on their website.

## Usage

This is a basic example showing how to add a fadeIn and fadeOut animation to a component.

**NOTE:** In order for the fadeOut animation to occur, instead of conditionally rendering the component you must pass ``false`` to the ``visible`` prop when the component should no longer be visible.

```js
import Animate from '@charlesvien/react-animatecss';

<Animate
  animationIn="fadeIn"
  animationOut="fadeOut"
  inDuration={1000}
  outDuration={1000}
  visible
>
  Magnolia
</Animate>
```
